# JS-MemoryGame

# This is my version for the web of Memory Game based on the 'Fabulous Fred' electronic game that first appeared during the 80's
# Rules for this game are quite simple. The game starts when the user press the start button. The computer will select a number betwen 1-9 then it will inform a user of its selection by highlighting the button corresponding that number on the dashboard. Buttons are numbered 1-9 starting from red on the top left side and going clockwise as follows.
# 1 - 2 - 3
# 8 - 9 - 4
# 7 - 6 - 5

After the initial move, the user must push the same buttons the computer did in a previous turn. The goal is to remember the most of the buttons picked by the computer.
Computer is unbeatable just as the original game. This game was designed by Mega Corp probably as a way to support cognitive activities and brain. There is no much information in regards to the ultimate purpose of this game just links that reference the game or taking the user to buy one of the few devices out there.
The game was build with basic HTML and CSS. The core of the game relies heavily on its JScript module.

# 10/01/2023 - Game runs as expected excep there should be a delay when pc is playing;

# 10/01/2023 - Refactored the code. Game performs as expected. See credits on the styles.css file.
